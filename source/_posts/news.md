To begin, I've got some news related to some future plans of Liquid Porting & Development Team and some notices that I won't repeat again and again.

### This Website
First of, I have to tell you something about this website and it's purpose.
This website was recently created to share all our work, since we don't want to use our [Facebook page](https://facebook.com/liquidporting) as our main page, so that's why you are reading these words right here and right now.
It's tailored specifically for sharing the latest ROM & Recovery builds for our supported devices.
Our team is aimed to provide the latest OS with high reliability and stability for as many devices as possible, **BUT** there's something we have to let you know about.

### Device requests and maintaining
If you are familiar with Android development for various devices at least a bit, you probably know, that there's a lot of fails, testing, compiling, coding in some cases behind bootable & fully stable ROM build and every device we build a custom software
for needs it's maintainer (at least one) so it's simply **IMPOSSIBLE** for us to build for every device you request because we don't have anyone, who owns that device and can maintain it, so what's why we are letting
you know about this little problem. If you are interested in maintaining a new device, contact us via E-mail or Facebook.
You must:

* Have a GitHub profile
* Knowledge about flashing, restoring bricked device, troubleshooting
* Have working source code for a particular device
* Be able to compile ROMs and recoveries

### Snapdragon & MediaTek (legacy devices in general)
Well, Liquid Porting & Development started with MediaTek devices based on MT6582, then continued with MT6592. We provided **MANY** custom ROMs with a bunch of features with different base such as AOSP and LineageOS (successor of CyanogenMod) for devices
running on these chipsets starting with KitKat based through Lollipop to Marshmallow. But even MediaTek development has it's limits and we decided to end support for our MediaTek devices due to lack of community support, and we couldn't handle it alone.
All MediaTek will recieve only TWRP updates since developers lost their interest in ROM development for MediaTek MT6582/92 so don't expect Nougat (7.1.2) or newer.

And now some words about Snapdragon devices. Since we ended our support for MediaTek devices (the old ones) we are going to start again and support Snapdragon devices with the latest Android OS version and TWRP recovery.
A list of devices with planned support includes following:

* Xiaomi Redmi 4A (rolex)
* Xiaomi Redmi 4X (santoni)
* Xiaomi Redmi 4 (prada)
* OnePlus 5 (cheeseburger)

If you want you device to be in this list and you got some skills in Android development, do not hesitate and let us know :)
