### When Phone Manufacturers Releases their phones, the Default Operating System placed inside them is called Stock Rom or Firmware

Stock ROM is always Almost Bugless and Smooth, but often it can Lag and Hang on High Use.

The Stock ROM of _Walton Primo RX5_ (And it's other ReBranded Models) is Gionee's _Amigo OS_.
It is namely Amigo OS v3.2, based on Android 6.0 Marshmallow.

Here, The Stock ROM is Converted into _TWRP Flashable_ ROM.
This is easily flashable from within phone as when we use Custom ROMs, there are a few bugs there, and often we need to go back to the Original ROM. That's why this file is convenient and time saving.

This ROM is made from _Factory Version_ (v5602). But this ROM does not include any OTA Fixes.
And it is Rooted using SuperSU.
But you could get OTA Support if you _Unroot_ your phone after you install this ROM. And after Unrooting, you might have to Flash your _Stock Recovery_ and Remove the _TWRP_ to get new updates.

### Pre-Requirements

- [x] Phone Rooted from PC
- [x] TWRP v3.0 Preferred

### How To Flash?

1. At First, Download this ROM (_.zip_) file and place inside External Memory Card or Internal Memory.
2. Reboot into TWRP Recovery Mode.
3. Backup "System", "Data", "NvRAM" and "NvData" partitions into External Memory Card using TWRP.
4. Wipe "System", "Data" and "Cache" partions only.
5. Install this Zip file from below.
6. After installation finishes, Reboot into New System.

Note: First Boot may take about 15-25 minutes.
